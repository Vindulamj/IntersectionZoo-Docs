*IntersectionZoo: Eco-driving for Benchmarking Multi-Agent Contextual Reinforcement Learning*

Despite the success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in simulated applications, its success in real-world applications has been rather limited. A key challenge lies in making multi-agent RL generalize across problem variations, a common requirement in many real-world problems. Contextual reinforcement learning (CRL) formalizes learning policies that generalize across problem variations. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks for multi-agent CRL that are based on real-world applications and also capture the open challenges of real-world problems that affect generalization (e.g., partial observability and multiple competing objectives) has hindered the progress. To bridge this gap, we propose IntersectionZoo, a comprehensive benchmark suite for assessing multi-agent CRL algorithms through the real-world application of cooperative eco-driving. Eco-driving aims to control a fleet of vehicles to reduce fleet-wise emissions and encodes many of the open challenges in real-world problems. IntersectionZoo is built on data-informed simulations of 16,334 signalized intersections derived from 10 major US cities, modeled in an industry-standard microscopic traffic simulator. By modeling factors affecting vehicular exhaust emissions (e.g., temperature, humidity), IntersectionZoo provides one million traffic scenarios. Using these traffic scenarios, we benchmark popular multi-agent RL and human-like driving algorithms and demonstrate that the popular multi-agent RL algorithms struggle to generalize in CRL settings
